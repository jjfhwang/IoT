# IoT

## Description

This repository houses a collection of Rust-based primitives for building secure and decentralized IoT solutions. It provides cryptographic protocol implementations, decentralized ledger building blocks, and secure computation capabilities, enabling developers to create robust and privacy-preserving IoT applications. The project aims to provide a foundational layer for secure data management, device authentication, and distributed consensus in resource-constrained environments. It prioritizes security, efficiency, and ease of integration for developers working on the cutting edge of IoT technology. This library is designed to be modular, allowing developers to select and integrate only the components they need for their specific use case.

## Features

*   **Decentralized Ledger Primitives:** Offers fundamental data structures and algorithms for constructing decentralized ledgers, including Merkle trees, cryptographic hash functions, and basic consensus mechanisms. These primitives allow for secure and tamper-proof data storage and sharing across a network of IoT devices.
*   **Cryptographic Protocol Implementations:** Provides implementations of essential cryptographic protocols, such as secure key exchange (e.g., Diffie-Hellman, ECDH), digital signatures (e.g., Ed25519), and authenticated encryption (e.g., AES-GCM). These protocols enable secure communication and authentication between IoT devices and servers.
*   **Secure Computation (MPC) Building Blocks:** Implements basic building blocks for secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocols. These include secret sharing schemes, garbled circuits, and homomorphic encryption primitives. Enables computations on sensitive data without revealing the data itself.
*   **Hardware Security Module (HSM) Abstraction:** Provides an abstraction layer for interacting with Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). This enables secure key storage and cryptographic operations to be performed within a tamper-resistant hardware environment.
*   **Resource-Constrained Optimization:** Designed with resource-constrained IoT devices in mind, the library is optimized for low memory footprint and efficient execution.

## Installation

To install and use this project, you need to have Rust and Cargo installed. You can download and install Rust from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/IoT.git
    cd IoT
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```

    This will download and compile all the necessary dependencies specified in the `Cargo.toml` file.

## Usage

Here are a few examples demonstrating how to use the library's features:

**Example 1: Using the Merkle Tree implementation**

```rust
use iot::ledger::merkle_tree::MerkleTree;
use sha2::{Sha256, Digest};

fn main() {
    // Sample data
    let data = vec![
        "data1".as_bytes().to_vec(),
        "data2".as_bytes().to_vec(),
        "data3".as_bytes().to_vec(),
        "data4".as_bytes().to_vec(),
    ];

    // Hash function
    let hash_fn = |data: &[u8]| -> Vec<u8> {
        let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
        hasher.update(data);
        hasher.finalize().to_vec()
    };

    // Create a Merkle Tree
    let merkle_tree = MerkleTree::new(data, &hash_fn);

    // Get the root hash
    let root_hash = merkle_tree.root();
    println!("Merkle Root: {:?}", root_hash);

    // Verify a leaf (example with the first leaf)
    let proof = merkle_tree.get_proof(0).unwrap();
    let leaf = "data1".as_bytes().to_vec();

    let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
    hasher.update(&leaf);
    let leaf_hash = hasher.finalize().to_vec();

    let is_valid = merkle_tree.verify_proof(&leaf_hash, &proof, &root_hash, &hash_fn);
    println!("Proof is valid: {}", is_valid);
}
```

**Example 2: Using the Ed25519 signature scheme**

```rust
use iot::crypto::ed25519;

fn main() {
    // Generate a keypair
    let (public_key, secret_key) = ed25519::generate_keypair();

    // Message to sign
    let message = b"This is a message to be signed";

    // Sign the message
    let signature = ed25519::sign(message, &secret_key);

    // Verify the signature
    let is_valid = ed25519::verify(message, &signature, &public_key);

    println!("Signature is valid: {}", is_valid);
}
```

**Example 3: Using a basic Secret Sharing Scheme (Shamir's Secret Sharing)**

```rust
use iot::secure_computation::sss;

fn main() {
    // Secret to be shared
    let secret: u64 = 12345;
    // Number of shares to create
    let num_shares: u8 = 5;
    // Threshold of shares needed to reconstruct the secret
    let threshold: u8 = 3;

    // Create shares
    let shares = sss::split_secret(secret, num_shares, threshold).unwrap();

    // Reconstruct the secret from a subset of shares
    let mut subset_shares = Vec::new();
    for i in 0..threshold {
        subset_shares.push(shares[i as usize].clone());
    }

    let reconstructed_secret = sss::reconstruct_secret(&subset_shares).unwrap();

    println!("Original Secret: {}", secret);
    println!("Reconstructed Secret: {}", reconstructed_secret);
    assert_eq!(secret, reconstructed_secret);
}
```

These examples provide a starting point for using the library's functionalities. Refer to the module documentation within the source code for a more detailed explanation of each function and its parameters.
