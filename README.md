# IoT

## Description

This repository provides a framework for building robust and efficient IoT applications using Rust. It aims to simplify the development process by offering a set of modular components and utilities specifically designed for resource-constrained environments and real-time data processing. The project prioritizes security, reliability, and performance, enabling developers to create scalable and maintainable IoT solutions. It provides abstractions for common IoT tasks such as sensor data acquisition, device communication, and data storage.

## Features

*   **Modular Architecture:** The framework is built around a modular design, allowing developers to select and integrate only the components they need for their specific application. This reduces code bloat and improves overall performance.
*   **Asynchronous Communication:** Utilizes Rust's `async/await` features to enable non-blocking communication with IoT devices and cloud services. This allows for efficient handling of multiple concurrent connections and improved responsiveness.
*   **Data Serialization/Deserialization:** Provides built-in support for common data serialization formats like JSON and CBOR, making it easy to exchange data with other systems.
*   **Secure Communication:** Implements secure communication protocols such as TLS/SSL to protect sensitive data transmitted between devices and the cloud.
*   **Sensor Abstraction Layer:** Offers a high-level abstraction layer for interacting with various types of sensors, simplifying sensor data acquisition and processing.

## Installation

Before installing the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

*   **Rust Toolchain:** Install the latest stable version of Rust using `rustup`:

    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

    Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

*   **Cargo:** Cargo is Rust's package manager and build system, and it's included with the Rust toolchain. Verify that Cargo is installed by running:

    ```bash
    cargo --version
    ```

*   **Dependencies:** This project relies on several external crates.  These will be automatically downloaded and built by Cargo when you build the project.  However, you may need to install system dependencies depending on the features you enable.  For example, if you plan to use TLS/SSL, you may need to install OpenSSL.

    On Debian/Ubuntu:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
    ```

    On Fedora/CentOS/RHEL:

    ```bash
    sudo dnf install openssl-devel
    ```

    On macOS:

    ```bash
    brew install openssl
    ```

Once you have the prerequisites installed, you can clone the repository and build the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/IoT.git
cd IoT
cargo build
```

To build in release mode (optimized for performance):

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

Here are some example code snippets demonstrating how to use the framework:

**1. Reading Sensor Data:**

```rust
use tokio::time::{sleep, Duration};
use rand::Rng;

// Assuming you have a sensor module defined
mod sensor {
    pub struct SensorData {
        pub temperature: f32,
        pub humidity: f32,
    }

    pub async fn read_sensor_data() -> SensorData {
        // Simulate reading data from a sensor
        let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
        let temperature = rng.gen_range(20.0..30.0);
        let humidity = rng.gen_range(40.0..60.0);
        SensorData { temperature, humidity }
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    loop {
        let data = sensor::read_sensor_data().await;
        println!("Temperature: {}, Humidity: {}", data.temperature, data.humidity);
        sleep(Duration::from_secs(5)).await;
    }
}
```

**2. Sending Data to a Cloud Service (Example using HTTP):**

```rust
use reqwest;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use tokio::time::{sleep, Duration};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
struct SensorData {
    temperature: f32,
    humidity: f32,
}

// Assuming you have a sensor module defined
mod sensor {
    use rand::Rng;

    pub struct SensorData {
        pub temperature: f32,
        pub humidity: f32,
    }

    pub async fn read_sensor_data() -> SensorData {
        // Simulate reading data from a sensor
        let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
        let temperature = rng.gen_range(20.0..30.0);
        let humidity = rng.gen_range(40.0..60.0);
        SensorData { temperature, humidity }
    }
}


#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let client = reqwest::Client::new();

    loop {
        let sensor_data = sensor::read_sensor_data().await;
        let data = SensorData {
            temperature: sensor_data.temperature,
            humidity: sensor_data.humidity,
        };

        let url = "https://example.com/api/data"; // Replace with your API endpoint

        let res = client.post(url)
            .json(&data)
            .send()
            .await?;

        println!("Status: {}", res.status());

        sleep(Duration::from_secs(10)).await;
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

**3.  Example of using a configuration file**

```rust
use serde::Deserialize;
use std::fs;

#[derive(Deserialize, Debug)]
struct Config {
    device_id: String,
    server_address: String,
    sensor_type: String,
}

fn load_config(path: &str) -> Result<Config, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let contents = fs::read_to_string(path)?;
    let config: Config = toml::from_str(&contents)?; // Assuming you are using toml for configuration
    Ok(config)
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let config_path = "config.toml"; // Or wherever your config is.
    let config = load_config(config_path)?;

    println!("Device ID: {}", config.device_id);
    println!("Server Address: {}", config.server_address);
    println!("Sensor Type: {}", config.sensor_type);

    // Rest of your IoT application logic using the config

    Ok(())
}
```

Make sure to create a `config.toml` file alongside the rust code:

```toml
device_id = "my_device_123"
server_address = "192.168.1.100:8080"
sensor_type = "temperature_humidity"
```

**Note:**  These examples are simplified for demonstration purposes.  In a real-world application, you would need to handle errors, implement proper data validation, and potentially use a more sophisticated communication protocol.  You also will need to add `reqwest = { version = "0.11" , features = ["json"] }` and `serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }` and `tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }` and `rand = "0.8"` and `toml = "0.8"` to your `Cargo.toml` file under the `[dependencies]` section.
